name: Benchmark Trigger

# Trigger benchmark CI workflows when benchmark PR labels are added.
# When a benchmark label is added, this cancels and then re-runs the CI
# workflow. When the workflow is re-run, it will pick up the latest PR
# description and labels. See
# https://github.com/openxla/iree/issues/10042#issuecomment-1449250094 for
# more background.
#
# This workflow is running on the base branch the PR targets.
